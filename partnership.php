      <p id="exception3">Calvert Investments (Now Calvert Research and Management)
        was founded in 1988 to offer investors more direct ways to invest in communities.
         Working with individual investors has always
        been part of their mission.
        They were one of the first “impact investments” available through brokerage accounts.
        They aim to make impact investing accessible and relevant to a diverse range of investors.

      to assume responsibility for the Giving Fund and transform it into
      something much bigger.
      ImpactAssets is an independent 501(c)3 organization, but remains closely
      connected to Calvert Impact Capital. Board members designated by Calvert
      Impact Capital hold a minority position on ImpactAssets’ Board of
      Directors and Community Investment Partners.
