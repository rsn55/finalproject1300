    <h2>What is Impact Investing?</h2>
    <!-- <div id="definition">
      <h2 id="deftitle">Impact Investment</h2>
      <p id="defpronounce">[im-pakt in-vest-muh nt]</p>
      <p>NOUN: Impact investing is investing that aims to generate specific beneficial social
        or environmental effects in addition to financial gain.</p>
      </div> -->
<div class="centEd">
      <p>Impact investments are investments made into companies, organizations,
        and funds with the intention to generate social and environmental impact
        alongside a financial return. Impact investments can be made in both emerging
        and developed markets, and target a range of returns from below market to market rate,
        depending on investors' strategic goals. </p>

        <h2>Why Impact Investing?</h2>
        <p>Impact investing challenges the long-held views
          that social and environmental issues should be addressed only by philanthropic donations,
          and that market investments should focus exclusively on achieving financial returns.</p>

          <p>The impact investing market offers diverse and viable opportunities for investors
            to advance social and environmental solutions through investments that also produce
            financial returns. </p>
