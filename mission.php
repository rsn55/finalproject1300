          <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
          <p> "Given our global political climate, it has become more important
            now than ever before to understand and take responsibility for the
            implications of our actions as citizens of the world. I strongly
            believe that impact investing allows people the opportunity to
            do just that, supporting ventures that create paths toward a
            healthier planet. Impact investing though projected to be the
            upcoming trend within the world of finance, really hasn’t reached
            the mainstream yet. Thus our purpose of founding CII, one of the
            only impact investing undergraduate clubs in the country, was to
            take on a pioneering role and allow more people the opportunity
            to learn and get involved in impact investing. In this way, our
            hope for CII is to not only bring in people with prior finance
            experience, but to expand the scope of this niche to people of
            different backgrounds and skillsets." </p>

        <h2>What is Impact Investing?</h2>
        <div class="centEd">
          <p>Impact investments are investments made into companies, organizations,
            and funds with the intention to generate social and environmental impact
            alongside a financial return. Impact investments can be made in both emerging
            and developed markets, and target a range of returns from below market to market rate,
            depending on investors' strategic goals. </p>

              <h2>Why Impact Investing?</h2>
              <p>Impact investing challenges the long-held views
                that social and environmental issues should be addressed only by philanthropic donations,
                and that market investments should focus exclusively on achieving financial returns.</p>

                <p>The impact investing market offers diverse and viable opportunities for investors
                  to advance social and environmental solutions through investments that also produce
                  financial returns. </p>
